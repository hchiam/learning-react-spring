# Learning react-spring

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

<https://www.react-spring.io>

CSS transitions _are_ performant and good enough for common one-off tasks, but react-spring has some special properties:

- not time-based
- fluid interactivity
- interruptibility
- concurrency
- and apparently things like easy [time-travel and slow-motion](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tavDv5hXpo?controls=1&start=370)?

[Think in terms of springs instead of durations. Get natural realistic interactive fluidity.](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring#why-springs-and-not-durations)

```bash
npm install react-spring
```
